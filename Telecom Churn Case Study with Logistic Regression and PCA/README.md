# Telecom-Churn-Case-Study
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.
For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal.
To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

# Description
Feature selection is the first and most important step of any model design because it can reduce overfitting, improves accuracy and reduces training time.
I have used 6 features selection algorithm in this case study.
After preprocessing the data and performing feature engineering, I have implemented two machine learning models Logistic Regression and PCA.
